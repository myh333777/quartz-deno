# Main Text

As a mentor to doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows, I put a particular investment of my own energies into the _input_ and _output_ phases of the research process. The effort involved in between—the background research, experimentation, data analysis, etc. that define the investigation—is typically in the hands of the students and fellows.

The input encompasses setting a research project goal, often consisting of an applied target accompanied by a key scientific question that needs to be addressed to inform a new design to meet said applied target. At this initial stage in the process, I offer my own reflections on the student’s project vision and strategy/plan, but, at least as importantly, I seek to bring together a small team to critique, iteratively, the student’s target, hypothesis, and plan of approach.

The output involves communicating the results to others—i.e., creating the manuscript for submission to the journal. This article is about our process regarding the output.

## Seven Tips on Crafting Papers

(1)**The art of positive visualization: start with the figure set.** I learned early in my career from eminent colleagues that one good strategy can be to start with the figure set… even before we have the full and final set of data for the paper! It’s a great aid for crafting the logic and flow of the paper. The holes in this emerging figure set are the still-remaining work items on the critical path to the paper. This helps the first author prioritize the remaining time spent.

(2)**Outline the logical flow and narrative: get lots of feedback at this stage. This is the time to iterate and optimize the logical flow.** Before writing prose, write—as bullets or a flowchart—the logical sequence of ideas, and transitions therebetween, that will make the work most clear. Discuss _this_ a lot with colleagues and advisors. When you get this right, the manuscript will (almost!) write itself. This is the time to iterate, shuffle the deck, reorder, or realize there’s one key experiment missing. If you get lots of feedback at this stage, there will be fewer tears later—such as when you present a “perfect” manuscript to your advisor that you’ve polished so much that you can’t bear to see changes/edits.

(3)**The best narratives are almost never chronological accounts of your actual real-time journey through the project.** You did the work in some order: you had an idea, you tried it, it failed, you had another idea, you thought that worked but later discovered it was an artifact, you went to play Spikeball, etc. Not only do you not need to tell the story in the order in which it happened… but it will be hard to follow if you do. See item 2 above: work with the outline; iterate on the outline; and develop a sequence that flows, is easy to follow, and engages the reader.

(4)**Failed early attempts can help you create a dramatic tension and a feeling of anticipation in the reader.** Sometimes I see drafts in which, early in the abstract and also early in the manuscript, we jump too soon to: “Here we find that, by using 2-N,4-N,6-N,8-N-snuffleupagus(3-methylphenyl)pyrimido[5,4-_d_]pyrimidine-2,4,6,8-tetramine as hole transport layer, we achieved a record solar PCE.”

If the first thing that we tried had worked, the accomplishment is less likely to have been a substantive advance informed by deep and original reasoning.

If you look back at how the work actually went in the lab, often your first attempts—the preludes to your eventual and ultimate success—did not proceed as hoped. You tried the obvious things that a reasonable expert would have done… and the approach failed. This sets the stage for your eventual accomplishment and will highlight that it was not trivial at all: instead, it required innovation.

We then seek to learn from these failures—study their origins. What is it, mechanistically, that accounts for the fact that known prior art, when straightforwardly combined, failed to produce the intended result?

These studies may well spotlight a factor that has been previously overlooked or underemphasized. The new model you develop will inform how you’ll innovate your way out of the problem: only by doing X were we able to overcome this now-understood mechanism that we now know was at the root of the failure of the obvious combination.

The approach I outline above isn’t the only way to write an interesting and engaging paper. It illustrates a broader principle that does cut across many good papers: they have a plot. Often there are struggles and disappointments; then a suite of studies motivated by curiosity, driven forth by the instinct to investigate; then a phase of innovation enabled by the resultant insights; finishing with a significant achievement that relied on the innovative step.

(5)**Stand proudly on the shoulders of giants and delineate clearly when this tribute is complete and where we have moved on to your original work.** The literature review should be generous to those who have come before you and whose works form the foundations of what you’re doing. Once you’ve done this, transition clearly, with a fresh new paragraph, to your new effort/hypothesis/attempt. Consider using different verb tenses or other markers to delineate clearly {the tops of the giants’ shoulders} from {the bottoms of your sneakers}.

(6)**The harm, and the cure, should be commensurable—in proportion with one another—and should be precisely formulated.** To borrow from the brilliant Prof. Yogi Surendranath: if the harm (problem to overcome) that you present is “the world emits 39 Gton CO2/year,” then the cure (your achievement) needs to be that you reached carbon neutrality by the end of the paper. If the harm is “the mechanisms of degradation of perovskite solar cells are incompletely understood...” then they’d better be completely understood by the end of the paper!

The harm and cure need to be suitably modest, precise, and in proportion with one another: “In sum, 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures provide major performance advances, but have so far failed to translate to inverted cells; here we report a method that tunes the band structure of 2D perovskites to address this problem, enabling as a result electrons to travel upward to the electron-collector without barrier.”

(7)**Use an economy of words, and submit the paper when it is 90% perfect.** Referees will always ask you for more work, but it’s hard to predict exactly what they’ll want (which is the beauty of the peer review process: there is huge information content and value in what we learn from reviewer feedback, evidenced by the fact that we cannot predict what it will be). Reviewers will always find something, and it will always help make the paper better, and by leaving a bit of room to fill out the paper in light of their feedback, you’ve created an opening for reviewers to offer worthwhile feedback that you can act upon.

The hero of my hometown, Sir Terry Matthews, was reputed to say: “When you’re a start-up, the purpose of making a product is to get the chance to show it to a customer—so that the customer can tell you which product you should actually make!” When you submit an article to a journal, you engage with expert referees and secure their feedback. With the aid of their insight, you learn what is required for you to take this paper the rest of the way to publish-ability.

A few warts might be okay; the paper must be of sufficient quality and rigor to engage the referees in a substantive expert conversation. Even if you think it’s perfect, the referees won’t!

## Three Additional Considerations

(8)**Interpret peer review comments through this lens: how could I use this feedback to improve the work?** Referee reports often contain constructive recommendations that are clearly intended to help you make the better paper. Sometimes they also contain language that you’ll experience as harsh or negative.

And yet, it’s always possible to find the constructive in what feel like criticisms. Ask: “if what I wrote originally left this impression with the reviewer, then how could I revisit my studies, their interpretation, and their presentation to create a more balanced perspective?” Often harsh feedback contains clues to a misunderstanding—and thus a chance to improve clarity in your next submission. Often the feedback is an invitation to acknowledge alternative interpretations of your findings—ideas that weren’t part of your original agenda, but that, once captured in the revised manuscript, communicate your openness of mind and thus invite a future conversation in the literature. I try to avoid arguing with referees in my point-by-point response; instead, I try to show how we’ve made the work better in light of the broader spirit of their feedback.

(9)**On cover letters.** In my experience, journal editors read the cover letter _and_ they read the manuscript. For this and other reasons, we don’t retread the same territory in the two documents. Typically, the cover letter will be a bit more engaging, a bit more accessible, and a little more zoomed out. It will contain one visual element—a graphic or a table—illustrating the main new idea and the applied achievement, i.e., the new quantitative figure of merit achieved relative to relevant prior art.

I tend to offer about 10–12 referee suggestions. This sounds like a lot, but editors at even the highest impact factor journals have a surprisingly hard time finding referees. I take a _Team of Rivals_ approach to suggested referees: I recommend the people in my field and in nearby fields who are the most rigorous, the most expert, and thus those who are also my direct competition. In this way I get the highest quality feedback, and I communicate to the editor my confidence in the work. I don’t ask for reviewers to be excluded.

I aim for diversity in the list: intellectual diversity, of course (some who could review the theory, others who could review certain key experimental methods, and some who appreciate the systems-level big picture), and, crucially, also diversity of geography, gender, career stage, and beyond. Diversity, equity, and inclusion permeates every stage of the research and graduate training process today, as it should, and so it should too for peer review.

(10)**Do as I say, not as I do.** A reader will detect some of the above elements in our group’s papers from the past 24 years, and many violations of these guidelines as well! What I wrote above is a summary snapshot of how I think, at breakfast on a day in July 2022, about the art and science of paper writing. It has evolved in time, and it continues to be dynamic to this day. I encourage all to develop and evolve your own philosophy of scholarly dissemination, to pause periodically to write this down as an intentional approach, and to bring your own personal lens to how you communicate about your work. I hope that this letter will spark for me some follow-up conversations with students, post-docs, and faculty members as we continue to update our vision of the process of journal article writing, and I welcome that dialogue.

作为博士生和博士后的导师，我把自己的精力投入到研究过程的输入和输出阶段。所涉及的工作中，文章的研究背景、实验、数据分析等，通常由学生负责。

输入阶段需要设定研究项目目标，通常包括一个应用目标和一个需要解决的关键科学问题，以便为实现上述应用目标提供信息。在初始阶段，我对学生的项目愿景和计划提出自己的看法。之后，我召集一个小团队，反复讨论学生的目标、假设和方法计划。

输出阶段主要是与他人交流成果，即完成手稿并提交期刊。

以下是关于我们输出的过程。

**写手稿的7个技巧**  

**1. 积极可视化的艺术：从图开始。**  

在我职业生涯的早期，就从成名的同事那里学到了一个很好的策略，那就是从图开始，甚至在我们写论文和收集数据之前就开始！

这对论文的逻辑和流程有很大帮助。图中的空缺和漏洞告诉我们还有哪些未完成的工作，这有助于第一作者预估时间。

**2. 概述逻辑和叙述：在这个阶段获得大量的反馈，然后进行迭代和优化。**

在写文章之前，以流程图的形式写下观点的逻辑顺序，以及两者间的关系，这将使文章更清晰。要与同事和导师经常讨论这个问题。当你掌握了这一点，手稿几乎是水到渠成。

然后是迭代、重新排序或意识到缺少一个关键的实验。如果你在这个阶段得到大量反馈，那么你后续的痛苦就会减少。比如，当你把一份“完美”的手稿交给你的导师时，你已经把它打磨得非常好，以至于你不忍心看到任何修改。

**3. 最好的叙述不是按你工作的时间顺序。**

你有一个想法，你尝试它，失败了，你有另一个想法，你认为那是可行的，但后来发现那是个伪命题。你不需要按照事情发生的顺序来讲述故事。

如果你这样做，可能很难让别人看懂。你应该参照第2项：使用大纲；迭代大纲；并制定一个流畅、易于理解和吸引读者的顺序。

**4. 早期的失败可以帮助你，在读者中创造一种戏剧性的紧张感和期待感。**

如果我们第一次尝试就成功了，那么这项成就不太可能是由深刻和原始推理的实质性进展。如果你回顾一下实验室的实际工作情况，你的第一次尝试和最终成功的前奏，往往没有按预期进行。你尝试了一个专家会做的显而易见的事情，但这种方法却失败了。

这为你的最终成功奠定了基础，并将强调它并非微不足道，相反，它需要创新。然后，我们从这些失败中吸取教训。

这些研究很可能会关注到以前被忽视或未被充分重视的因素。开发的新模型将说明如何创新地解决这个问题：只有通过做X，才能克服当前被理解的机制，我们现在知道这种机制是明显组合失败的根源。

我上面概述的方法并不是写一篇有趣和吸引人的论文的唯一方法。但它说明了一个更广泛的原则，它确实贯穿了许多好的论文：它们有一个情节。通常会有挣扎和失望；然后是由好奇心驱动的一系列研究，由此产生的见解，将促成进入创新阶段；最后是依靠创新步骤取得重大成就。

**5. 自豪地站在巨人的肩膀上，清楚地描绘前人工作完成的时间，以及后续发展。**

文献综述应该提到前人的研究，他们的工作构成了你研究项目的基础。之后，用新的段落清楚地过渡到你的新努力/假设/尝试。

切记，将前人的工作和你的工作清楚地划分出来。

**6. 危害和解决方法应该是相称的、彼此成比例的，并且应该精确地制定。**

借用杰出的Yogi Surendranath教授的话：如果你提出的危害（需要克服的问题）是“世界每年排放39G吨CO2”，那么解决方法（你的成就）需要是你在论文结束时达到碳中和。

危害和解决方法需要适度、精确，并且彼此相称。

**7. 尽量少写字，并在论文字数达到90%的完美程度时提交。**

审稿人总是会要求你做更多的工作，但很难预测他们到底想要什么（这正是同行评审过程的魅力所在：我们从审稿人的反馈中学到的东西有巨大的信息量和价值，我们无法预测会是什么）。

审稿人总是会发现一些东西，而这些东西总是让论文变得更好。为审稿人创造一个机会，让他们提供有价值的反馈。在他们的帮助下，你了解到你需要什么来完善这篇论文。

有一些缺陷是可以的，但论文必须有足够高的质量和严谨性，以便与审稿人进行实质性对话。即使你认为它是完美的，审稿人却不会这么认为。

**另外3个考虑因素**  

**8. 解读同行评审意见：我怎样才能利用这些反馈来改进工作？**

评审报告往往包含建设性的建议，显然是为了帮助你更好地撰写论文。同时，它们也包含一些让你觉得苛刻或消极的语言。  

然而，我们总是能在批评中找到建设性的意见。“如果我最初写的东西给审稿人留下了这样的印象，那么我如何重新审视我的研究、他们的解释和他们的表述，以创造一个更均衡的视角？”

严格的反馈包含了误解，因此再次提交时要提高论文的清晰度。通常，反馈意见是让你对你的研究结果进行其他解释，这些想法并不在你的初稿中，但一旦包含在修改后的稿件中，就会传达出你的开放性。

我尽量避免在回复中与审稿人争论；相反，我试图说明我们如何根据他们的反馈使工作变得更好。

**9. 关于Cover Letter。**

根据我的经验，期刊编辑会阅读Cover Letter和手稿。由于这个原因，我们不会在这两份文件中重复相同的内容。

通常，Cover Letter会更有吸引力，更容易理解。它将包含一个视觉元素（图形或表格），以说明主要的新想法和应用成果，即相对于现有技术所取得的新的量化成果。

我倾向于提供大约10-12个审稿人。这听起来很多，但即使是影响因子最高的期刊，他们的编辑也很难找到审稿人。

我推荐审稿人时，会选择我所在领域和相关领域中最严谨、最专业的人，因此也是我的直接竞争对手。通过这种方式，我得到了最高质量的反馈，并向编辑传达我对工作的信心。我不要求把审稿人排除在外。

我力求名单的多样性：当然是智力上的多样性（有些人可以审查理论，有些人可以审查某些关键的实验方法，有些人可以审查系统层面的大局），关键是，还有地域、性别、职业阶段等方面的多样性。

如今，多样性、公平性和包容性渗透到了研究和研究生培训过程的每个阶段，这是应该的，对于同行评审也应该如此。

**10. 照我说的做，而不是照我做的做。**

读者会在我们小组过去24年的论文中发现上述的一些内容，也会发现许多违反这些准则的情况！

上面所写的，是我在2022年7月的某一天吃早餐时，对论文写作的艺术和科学的看法。它随着时间的推移不断发展，直到今天，仍然是不断发展的。

我鼓励大家发展和优化你们自己的学术传播哲学，定期思考并写下来，将自己的个人视角带到你们的工作中。

我希望这封信能激发我与学生、博士后和教师的一些后续对话，持续更新我们对期刊文章写作过程的看法，我欢迎这种对话。
