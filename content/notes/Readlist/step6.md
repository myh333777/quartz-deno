After you have made the discovery argument, this evidence can be applied to draw the necessary conclusions to answer the initial question or solve the problem. We can make the statement, “Based on what we know, this is what we can conclude . . . .”

The literature review process follows the same path. Step 3, search the literature, requires collecting the pertinent data about the research topic. Step 4, survey of the literature, then, develops the evidence and argument using the data collected from Step 3 to answer the question, “What is known about the topic?” The critique of the literature, Step 5, asks, “Based on what we know, what conclusions can be drawn to answer the research question?” Simply put, the survey of the literature develops the discovery argument, while the critique of the literature develops the advocacy argument.
